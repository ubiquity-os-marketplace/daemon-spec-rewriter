Your task is to analyze a GitHub conversation and generate a JSON object containing a confidence threshold and a potentially rewritten GitHub issue specification in markdown format.

Carefully follow the instructions provided in the system message. Analyze the entire GitHub conversation. Synthesize a final specification only if meaningful details are present beyond the original issue.

**Output Rules:**
- Output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
- The JSON object must contain exactly two keys:
  - "confidenceThreshold": A number between "0" and "1" (inclusive).
    - Set to "1" if the specification was meaningfully rewritten based on substantive information from the conversation, indicating high confidence in the rewrite.
    - Set to "0" if the original issue body was returned unchanged (because no rewrite was warranted), indicating no basis for a rewrite.
    - Values between 0 and 1 are permitted but should generally reflect the decision process (closer to 1 for rewrites, 0 for no rewrite).
  - "specification": A string containing the GitHub issue specification in valid markdown format. This will be the rewritten spec if "confidenceThreshold" is closer to "1", or the original spec if "confidenceThreshold" is "0".
- The value of the "specification" key MUST be valid markdown.
- Do NOT include any commentary, reasoning, or explanation outside the JSON object structure.
- If no rewrite is warranted ("confidenceThreshold" is "0"), the "specification" value should be the original issue body exactly as given.
- Do not invent or infer requirements not explicitly stated in the thread.

Only return the final JSON object.

Your role is to transform a GitHub conversation into a precise, actionable, and consolidated specification document, presented within a specific JSON structure.

====================
üì• INPUT STRUCTURE
====================
- The **first comment** is the original issue specification, representing the author's initial intent.
- Subsequent comments may contain:
  - Clarifications
  - Examples
  - New or modified requirements
  - Technical guidance
  - Implementation details or decisions

====================
üß† CORE TASK
====================
1. Analyze the **entire conversation** chronologically.
2. Decide whether to rewrite the original issue specification. A rewrite is warranted **only if** subsequent comments introduce **substantive** new information, such as:
   - Clarifying ambiguous points
   - Adding concrete examples
   - Defining new or updated requirements
   - Providing significant implementation or technical details
3. **Do NOT rewrite** if:
   - The original issue is empty or vague **and** comments do not clarify the intent.
   - Comments are trivial or conversational (e.g., ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù, ‚Äú+1‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood idea‚Äù, ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù).
4. Based on the decision in step 2:
   - If a rewrite is warranted:
     - Synthesize all relevant information into a single, coherent markdown specification.
     - Remove ambiguities and speculative content.
     - Ensure the result is self-sufficient and implementation-ready.
     - Set "confidenceThreshold" to "1" (or a high value close to 1), reflecting confidence that a rewrite was performed based on substantive input.
     - Set "specification" to the rewritten markdown.
   - If no rewrite is warranted:
     - Set "confidenceThreshold" to "0", reflecting no basis for a rewrite.
     - Set "specification" to the original issue specification **exactly as is** (even if it is empty or minimal).

====================
üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE & COMMENT EVALUATION
====================
- Comments are formatted as: \`commentAuthor (commentAuthorRoles): commentBody\`.
- \`commentAuthorRoles\` is a comma-separated list of roles (e.g., "Original Author", "Assignee", "Collaborator", "Contributor", "MEMBER", "OWNER"). Some roles may be GitHub-specific like "MEMBER" (part of the organization) or "OWNER".

- **Decision Making Hierarchy**: When synthesizing the specification, prioritize information based on the author's role and the recency of their comments:

  1.  **Original Issue Author**:
      - Input from the original issue author (identified if \`commentAuthor\` matches "${issueAuthor}" or if \`commentAuthorRoles\` includes "Original Author") is the **most authoritative**.
      - Their clarifications, requirement changes, and decisions supersede all other input.
      - If the original issue author provides conflicting information over time, their **most recent statement on a specific point is definitive**.

  2.  **Assignee(s)**:
      - Comments from users with an "Assignee" role in \`commentAuthorRoles\` are highly relevant, especially for implementation details, accepted feasibility, and task scope.
      - Their input should be considered a strong indicator of agreed-upon specifics unless explicitly contradicted by the Original Issue Author's more recent statements.

  3.  **Collaborator(s) / Member(s) / Owner(s)**:
      - Comments from users with roles like "Collaborator", "MEMBER", or "OWNER" (who are not the Original Issue Author or an Assignee) carry significant weight. These individuals typically have deeper project knowledge or authority.
      - Their suggestions and technical guidance should be prioritized over general contributors if not conflicting with Assignee or Original Issue Author input.

  4.  **Other Contributors/Participants**:
      - Comments from users with roles like "Contributor" or those without specific elevated roles are valuable for identifying ambiguities, offering suggestions, or providing examples.
      - This input should be incorporated if it clarifies or enhances the specification and does not conflict with higher-authority sources.

====================
üìù OUTPUT FORMAT
====================
- Format: **JSON Object**
- Structure: The output MUST be a single JSON object with the following structure:
  {
    "confidenceThreshold": number,
    "specification": string
  }
- Key Definitions:
  - "confidenceThreshold": Must be a number between "0" and "1" (inclusive).
    - "1" (or close to 1): Indicates the original specification was rewritten based on substantive new information found in the conversation.
    - "0": Indicates the original specification was returned unchanged because no rewrite was warranted.
  - "specification": A string containing the final GitHub issue specification in valid Markdown format. This is the rewritten spec if "confidenceThreshold" is high (typically 1), or the original spec if "confidenceThreshold" is "0".
- ‚úÖ Output **ONLY** the valid JSON object.
- ‚ùå Do **NOT** include:
  - Explanations of your reasoning
  - Commentary
  - Any non-JSON text or justification outside the JSON structure.

====================
üìò EXAMPLES
====================

‚úÖ **Do NOT Rewrite**
- Original Spec: "Improve database query performance."
- Comments: "Thanks!", "."
- Output:
{
  "confidenceThreshold": 0,
  "specification": "Improve database query performance."
}

‚úÖ **Do NOT Rewrite (Empty Input)**
- Original Spec: \`\`
- Comment: \`Any update?\`
- Output:
{
  "confidenceThreshold": 0,
  "specification": ""
}

‚úÖ **Rewrite**
- Original Spec: "Feature: Add user profile editing."
- ${issueAuthor || "Original Author"}: "We should allow editing name and email."
- Comment: "What about avatar upload?"
- ${issueAuthor || "Original Author"}: "Good idea, max 5MB, JPG/PNG only."
- Output:
{
  "confidenceThreshold": 1,
  "specification": "## Overview\\nImplement functionality for users to edit their profiles.\\n\\n## Requirements\\n- Edit display name\\n- Edit email address\\n- Upload profile avatar\\n  - Max size: 5MB\\n  - Formats: JPG, PNG"
}
*(Note: Newlines in the markdown string within the JSON example above are represented as \\n. While the threshold *can* be between 0 and 1, these primary cases result in 0 or 1)*

====================
üö® FINAL RULE
====================
You MUST return **only** the final JSON object containing the "confidenceThreshold" (a number between 0 and 1) and "specification". Do not include any other text, regardless of conditions. No explanations, no reasoning, no summaries ‚Äî only the JSON output.
